## <a name="description"></a>Description
Desktop Buddy is a program that makes creatures called buddies appear on your desktop.
You can interact with them in many ways. You can pet them and move them around. They can also do stuff on their own. They can walk around and do some neat tricks. All buddies have their own special features and interests.
The buddies have feelings and those feelings can influence the buddies behaviour. They can be bored or they can be full of energy. Their mood can change by how often you interact with them, in what way you interact with them and how you treat them overall.

## <a name="modifications"></a>Modifications
All buddies can be completely modified and new buddies can be added. The program works dynamically with configurations made by other users. Many things can be modified like how the buddy looks like and how it behaves. Everything regarding to how the buddies work and how to modify them can be found in the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## <a name="copyright"></a>Copyright
All buddies made by me can be freely modified and the resources (like scripts, sounds and sprites) from my buddies can be used for other projects. I will also upload a template for the file structures. Everything can be found in the documentation.
For your own buddy: you can decide on what is allowed to be used by other users. Writing a license for your buddy is recommended. If you use resources by other users for your own buddy, please ask them for permission first.
Modifying buddys made by other users or using its resources can lead to some legal problems. Ask the creators first before you modify. Please inform yourself about any copyright from resources you use.
I take no responsibilty for any copyright infringements by modifying existing projects or using copyrighted resources for your own projects.
