## Description
Introducing Pokébuddy, your very own desktop companion! Its a delightful desktop pet that needs your care and attention. Pokébuddy scampers across your screen, eagerly seeks playtime with you and can even experience hunger.

### Never get bored
Never again find yourself with nothing to do! Your buddy is your constant playmate.

### Feelings Matter
Care for your buddy by feeding and playing with it. Keep it entertained to ensure it stays fond of you.

### A Curious Companion
Whether youre gaming or listening to music, your buddy loves to observe and share in your activities.

### Diverse Personalities
Each Pokémon boasts a unique personality, requiring distinct care. Some are bursting with energy, while others are more laid-back or have insatiable appetites.
