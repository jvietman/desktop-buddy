## <a name="description"></a>Description
Desktop Buddy is a program that makes buddies appear on your desktop.
You can interact with them and they can also do things by themselves. You can pet them and move them around. They can also move on their own and so some neat tricks.

## <a name="modifications"></a>Modifications
All buddies (that are made by me) can be completely modified and new buddies can be added. The program works dynamically with configurations of other users. Many things can be modified like how the buddy looks and how it behaves. Everything regarding to how the buddies work and how to modify them can be found in the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).
