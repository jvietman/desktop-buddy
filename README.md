## <a name="description"></a>Description
Desktop Buddy is a program that makes buddies appear on your desktop.
You can interact with them and they can also do things by themselves. You can pet them and move them around. They can also move on their own and so some neat tricks.

## <a name="modifications"></a>Modifications
All buddies can be completely modified and new buddies can be added. The program works dynamically with configurations of other users. Many things can be modified like how the buddy looks like and how it behaves. Everything regarding to how the buddies work and how to modify them can be found in the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## <a name="copyright"></a>Copyright
All buddies made by me can be freely modified and resources (like scripts, sounds and sprites) from my buddies can be used for other projects. I will also upload a template for the file structures. Everything can be found in the documentation.
For your own buddy: you can decide what is allowed to be used by other users. If you use resources by other users for your own buddy, please ask them for permission.
Modifying buddys made by other users or using its resources can lead to some legal problem. Ask the creators first before you modify. Please inform yourself about any copyright from resources you use.
